# Itheum Data Aggregator

The Data Aggregator smart contract offers a generalized platform built on the [MultiversX](https://multiversx.com) blockchain, aimed at orchestrating and delegating Data NFTs across a variety of applications.

Developers may register an application for their use case using the generalized smart contract managed by [Itheum](https://itheum.io), or may even deploy their own adapted smart contract from this template to account for more customized solutions.

## Practical Use

The Data Aggregator serves as a core infrastructure of the [Itheum protocol](<[https://](https://docs.itheum.io/)>) and enables various of use cases that involve the [Data NFT](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/product/data-nft) technology:

- [Data Coalitions](https://www.itheum.io/product#coaliation-daos): Internet-native entities that can own & trade data on behalf of users
- Data Docks: The bridge between user's Data NFTs and traditional platforms enabling data portability.

## Data Management & Access Control

Given the generalized nature of the Data Aggregator, users have strict and seamless control of their data delegations. They may allow or revoke access for a registered application at any given time.

Adhering to a core principle of Itheum where user's are in control of their data at all times.

## Key Features

- **Application Management**: Facilitates the registration, configuration, and deregistration of applications, creating an organized framework for data deployment.
- **NFT Delegation**: Empowers users to delegate their Data NFTs to applications for specified purposes, thereby enhancing the versatility and utility of data.
- **Administrative Oversight**: Ensures contract operation integrity through comprehensive administrative functionalities for managing the ecosystem's dynamics through the [Itheum DAO](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/protocol/governance).

## Conclusion

As a foundational element of the MultiversX blockchain infrastructure, the Data Aggregator smart contract facilitates a dynamic and secure exchange between Data NFT proprietors and applications. Its versatile design and extensive functionality position it as an invaluable asset in the evolving landscape of NFT and data management.
