# Itheum Data Aggregator

The Data Aggregator smart contract offers a generalized platform built on the [MultiversX](https://multiversx.com) blockchain, aimed at orchestrating and delegating Data NFTs across a variety of applications.

Developers may register an application for their use case using the generalized smart contract managed by [Itheum](https://itheum.io), or may even deploy their own adapted smart contract from this template to account for more customized solutions.

## Practical Use

The Data Aggregator serves as a core infrastructure of the [Itheum protocol](https://docs.itheum.io/) and enables various of use cases that involve the [Data NFT](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/product/data-nft) technology:

- [Data Coalitions](https://www.itheum.io/product#coaliation-daos): Internet-native entities that can own & trade data on behalf of users.
- Data Docks: The bridge between user's Data NFTs and traditional platforms enabling data portability.

## Key Features

- **Application Management**: Facilitates the registration, configuration, and deregistration of applications, creating an organized framework for data deployment.
- **NFT Delegation**: Empowers users to delegate their Data NFTs to applications for specified purposes, thereby enhancing the versatility and utility of data.
- **Administrative Oversight**: Ensures contract operation integrity through comprehensive administrative functionalities for managing the ecosystem's dynamics through the [Itheum DAO](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/protocol/governance).
- **Public API**: Offers read-only access to explore applications, delegations, and aggregations.

## Data Management & Access Control

Given the generalized nature of the Data Aggregator, users have strict and seamless control over their data delegations. They may allow or revoke access for a registered application at any given time, adhering to a core principle of Itheum where users are in control of their data at all times.

## Aggregator Service

The Data Aggregator service operates alongside the smart contract to facilitate the aggregation process, including optional curation tactics. It manages a wallet, known as the `deputy`, authorized to unlock Data NFTs owned by the Aggregator smart contract. This service represents a critical layer in ensuring efficient data management, and can be extended to gate consumer access through various monetization models.

## Conclusion

As a foundational element of the MultiversX blockchain infrastructure, the Data Aggregator smart contract facilitates a dynamic and secure exchange between Data NFT proprietors and applications. Its versatile design and extensive functionality position it as an invaluable asset in the evolving landscape of NFT and data management.
